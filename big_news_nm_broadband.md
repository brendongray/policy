# New Mexico broadband policy gets a boost in the legislative session
Last week was a big win for New Mexico broadband policy. A resolution passed by legislators proposes a constitutional amendment that would allow public spending on broadband investments. If passed by voters in November, the change would represent a generational shift in New Mexico broadband policy.

Currently, the state has an early 1900s-era constitutional provision that prevents state investment in almost all private industry. The so-called 'anti-donation' provision prevents the state from giving money to private companies, which includes money provided through grants. Across the country, grants have been used to stimulate broadband infrastructure build-out in places where industry can't make a profit. 

Much of New Mexico's most rural regions don't have the population density to make broadband infrastructure profitable for private providers. States with similar demographic contexts have turned to grants to overcome this. But New Mexico's restrictive anti-donation provision prevented the state from making those strategic investments. As a result, the state has the lowest rural connectivity in the US. The FCC estimates that a staggering 42% of people in rural NM don't have access to even basic internet speeds.

Legislative backing of the amendment is a huge step toward closing that gap. But it's just the first major obstacle to expanding comprehensive rural broadband. Voters are now on the hook to pass the amendment in the November general election. That might be easier said than done.
  
I'll leave the full political analysis to more qualified observers, but an incorrect narrative is already forming and it could have major implications for success in November. Larry Scott, a Republican state representative from Hobbs, told the ABQ Journal he worries about "politically directed capital" being doled out to "well-connected individuals." Scott's argument simply misses the mark. The amendment allows the legislature to offer support like grants for needed infrastructure. It's up to legislators to provide safeguards against corruption and political manipulation, and they'll do that through the legislation enabling grant programs. This is how it works in nearly every other state, and it's a logical approach.
  
Consider how NM broadband policy is operating currently. In 2021, New Mexico legislators passed sweeping investments in broadband, including about $70 million to create the Connect New Mexico Fund. But only public entities were eligible to apply for the program, and public entities in New Mexico don't provide broadband. Without the constitutional amendment, the state has few avenues to spend that money to actually build broadband. So far, that money has wisely been used for broadband planning activities. But in order to get shovels in the ground, a change to the constitution is required.
  
I suspect voters will see through whatever partisan manipulation occurs and pass the constitutional amendment come November. But the final obstacle to expanding broadband relies upon legislators having (and adhering to) a nuanced grasp of a critical aspect of broadband policy: speed minimums.
  
The world of broadband is full of technical jargon. The most important of that jargon is the acronym Mbps, which stands for megabits per second. Mbps is a measure of internet speed and it can measure both the download and upload speed of your internet connection (something like 100/5 Mbps refers to 100 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up).
  
Modern internet usage - everything from remote learning, telehealth, and working from home - requires a minimum speed of around 70 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload. Fiber optic cable technology is best suited for those speeds. The importance of fiber is projected to grow as more of daily life becomes enmeshed with the internet. Equitable fiber buildout is integral to ensuring rural residents have access to the full economic benefits of the internet now and in the future.
  
That's where legislation comes in. Lawmakers ought to require any company receiving public funds to build fiber infrastructure with the money, and minimum speed requirements are the best way to do so. Previous legislation passed by NM legislators required speeds matching the Federal Communications Commission's 25/5 Mbps requirements. But 25/5 Mbps doesn't cut it anymore. Those are speeds designated well before the vast array of internet applications we have today. Well-designed state programs should make it universally required that wireline infrastructure have speeds of at least 100/20 Mbps. That's the speed that companies are required to provide to be eligible for new federal funding under Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in November 2021. That's the speed New Mexico should use moving forward.
  
Speed requirements, of course, are just one part of the equation. This is a complex domain with lots of moving parts, and legislators should also acknowledge that a full solution to New Mexico's many broadband problems no doubt involves a mix of technology deployments. Fiber ought to be the backbone, but everything from municipal broadband, fixed wireless, TV white space, and even low-earth orbit satellites, will be required to connect the most rural communities.
  
That's the long game. In the short term, New Mexicans ought to support the constitutional amendment in November and get state money deployed where it can be used best.
